#' Interpolate missing intensities and calculate the area for a single EIC.

#'
#' This is an internal function. It interpolates missing y using linear
#' interpolation, and then calculates the area under the curve.
#'
#' @param x the positions of x(retention time) where non-NA y is observed.
#' @param y the observed intensities.
#' @param all.x all possible x(retention time) in the LCMS profile.
#' @param all.w the "footprint" of each measured retention time, used as weight
#' for the corresponding y.
#' @return The area is returned.
