\title{Align peaks from spectra into a feature table.}
\usage{
feature.align(features, min.exp = 2, mz.tol = NA, chr.tol = NA,
  find.tol.max.d = 1e-04, max.align.mz.diff = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{features}{A list object. Each component is a matrix which is the
output from proc.to.feature().}

\item{min.exp}{A feature has to show up in at least this number of profiles
to be included in the final result.}

\item{mz.tol}{The m/z tolerance level for peak alignment. The default is NA,
which allows the program to search for the tolerance level based on the
data. This value is expressed as the percentage of the m/z value. This
value, multiplied by the m/z value, becomes the cutoff level.}

\item{chr.tol}{The retention time tolerance level for peak alignment. The
default is NA, which allows the program to search for the tolerance level
based on the data.}

\item{find.tol.max.d}{Argument passed to find.tol(). Consider only m/z diffs
smaller than this value.This is only used when the mz.tol is NA.}

\item{max.align.mz.diff}{As the m/z tolerance is expressed in relative terms
(ppm), it may not be suitable when the m/z range is wide. This parameter
limits the tolerance in absolute terms. It mostly influences feature
matching in higher m/z range.}
}
\value{
Returns a list object with the following objects in it:
\item{aligned.ftrs}{A matrix, with columns of m/z values, elution times,
signal strengths in each spectrum.} \item{pk.times}{A matrix, with columns
of m/z, median elution time, and elution times in each spectrum.}
\item{mz.tol}{The m/z tolerance used in the alignment.} \item{chr.tol}{The
elution time tolerance in the alignment.}
}
\description{
Identifies which of the peaks from the profiles correspond to the same
feature.
}
\details{
The function first searches for the m/z tolerance level using a mixture
model. After the mz.tol is obtained, the peaks are grouped based on it.
Consecutive peaks with m/z value difference smaller than the tolerance level
are considered to belong to the same peak group. Non-parametric density
estimation within each peak group is used to further split peak groups.  The
function then searches for the retention time tolerance level. Because the
peaks are grouped using m/z, only metabolites that share m/z require this
parameter. A rather lenient retention time tolerance level is found using a
mixture model. After splitting the peak groups by this value, non-parametric
density estimation is used to further split peak groups. Peaks belonging to
one group are considered to correspond to the same feature.
