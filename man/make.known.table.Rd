\title{Producing a table of known features based on a table of metabolites and a
table of allowable adducts.}
\usage{
make.known.table(metabolite.table, adduct.table, ion.mode = "+")
}
\arguments{
\item{metabolite.table}{A table of known metabolites. See the description of
the object "metabolite.table" for details.}

\item{adduct.table}{A table of allowable adducts. See the description of the
object "adduct.table" for details.}

\item{ion.mode}{Character. Either "+" or "-".}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the known metabolite ions. It contains 18
columns: "chemical_formula": the chemical formula if knonw; "HMDB_ID": HMDB
ID if known; "KEGG_compound_ID": KEGG compound ID if known; "neutral.mass":
the neutral mass if known: "ion.type": the ion form, such as H+, Na+, ...,
if known; "m.z": m/z value, either theoretical for known metabolites, or
mean observed value for unknown but previously found features;
"Number_profiles_processed": the total number of LC/MS profiles that were
used to build this database; "Percent_found": in what percentage was this
feature found historically amount all data processed in building this
database; "mz_min": the minimum m/z value observed for this feature;
"mz_max": the maximum m/z value observed for this feature; "RT_mean": the
mean retention time observed for this feature; "RT_sd": the standard
deviation of retention time observed for this feature; "RT_min": the minimum
retention time observed for this feature; "RT_max": the maximum retention
time observed for this feature; "int_mean.log.": the mean log intensity
observed for this feature; "int_sd.log.": the standard deviation of log
intensity observed for this feature; "int_min.log.": the minimum log
intensity observed for this feature; "int_max.log.": the maximum log
intensity observed for this feature;
}
\description{
Given a table of known metabolites with original mass and charge
information, and a table of allowable adducts, this function outputs a new
table of potential features.
}
\details{
For each allowable ion form, the function produces the m/z of every
metabolite given to it. The output table follows the format that is required
by the function semi.sup(), so that the user can directly use the table for
semi supervised feature detection.
