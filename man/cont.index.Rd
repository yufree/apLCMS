\title{Continuity index}
\usage{
cont.index(newprof, min.pres = 0.6, min.run = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{newprof}{The matrix containing m/z, retention time, intensity, and EIC
label as columns.}

\item{min.pres}{Run filter parameter. The minimum proportion of presence in
the time period for a series of signals grouped by m/z to be considered a
peak.}

\item{min.run}{Run filter parameter. The minimum length of elution time for
a series of signals grouped by m/z to be considered a peak.}
}
\value{
A list is returned.  \item{new.rec}{ The matrix containing m/z,
retention time, intensity, and EIC label as columns after applying the run
filter. } \item{height.rec}{ The vector of peak heights. }
\item{time.range.rec}{ The vector of peak retention time span. }
\item{mz/pres.rec}{ The vector of proportion of non-missing m/z. }
}
\description{
This is an internal function. It uses continuity index (or "run filter") to
select putative peaks from EIC.
}
\details{
This is the run filter described in Yu et al Bioinformatics 2009.
