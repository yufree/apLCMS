\title{Adaptive binning}
\usage{
adaptive.bin(x, min.run, min.pres, tol, baseline.correct,
  weighted = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix with columns of m/z, retention time, intensity.}

\item{min.run}{Run filter parameter. The minimum length of elution time for
a series of signals grouped by m/z to be considered a peak.}

\item{min.pres}{Run filter parameter. The minimum proportion of presence in
the time period for a series of signals grouped by m/z to be considered a
peak.}

\item{tol}{m/z tolerance level for the grouping of data points. This value
is expressed as the fraction of the m/z value. This value, multiplied by the
m/z value, becomes the cutoff level. The recommended value is the machine's
nominal accuracy level. Divide the ppm value by 1e6. For FTMS, 1e-5 is
recommended.}

\item{baseline.correct}{After grouping the observations, the highest
intensity in each group is found. If the highest is lower than this value,
the entire group will be deleted. The default value is NA, in which case the
program uses the 75th percentile of the height of the noise groups.}
}
\value{
A list is returned.  \item{height.rec}{The records of the height of
each EIC.} \item{masses}{ The vector of m/z values after binning. }
\item{labels}{ The vector of retention time after binning. } \item{intensi}{
The vector of intensity values after binning. } \item{grps}{ The EIC labels,
i.e. which EIC each observed data point belongs to. } \item{times}{ All the
unique retention time values, ordered. } \item{tol}{ The m/z tolerance
level. } \item{min.count.run}{ The minimum number of elution time points for
a series of signals grouped by m/z to be considered a peak.}
\item{weighted}{Whether to weight the local density by signal intensities.}
}
\description{
This is an internal function. It creates EICs using adaptive binning
procedure
}
\details{
It uses repeated smoothing and splitting to separate EICs. The details are
described in the reference and flowchart.
