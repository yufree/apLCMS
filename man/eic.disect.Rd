\title{Internal function: Extract data feature from EIC.}
\usage{
eic.disect(raw.prof, smoother.window = c(1, 5, 10))
}
\arguments{
\item{raw.prof}{The data after adaptive binning, i.e. the output from
adaptive.bin.2().}

\item{smoother.window}{The smoother window sizes to use for data feature
extraction.}
}
\value{
A matrix. Every row corresponds to an EIC. Every column corresponds
to a data feature.
}
\description{
The function extracts data features after applying different smoother
settings.
}
\details{
We take a number of data characteristic measurements from each EIC,
including m/z span, m/z standard deviation, retention time (RT) span, RT
peak location, and summary statistics on the raw intensity values of the
EIC. We also centroid the data in each EIC such that it becomes
two-dimensional data (intensity v.s. RT). We then apply different smoothers
(shape/window size) in combination of different weighting schemes
(unweighted, weighted with intensity, weighted with log intensity) to each
EIC. At each smoothing setting, we record summary statistics of smoothed
data.
