\title{Internal function: Calculate the single predictor quality.}
\usage{
eic.qual(eic.rec, known.mz, mass.matched = NA, match.tol.ppm = 5,
  do.plot = FALSE, pos.confidence = 0.99, neg.confidence = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{eic.rec}{The EIC data feature matrix. Each row is an EIC. Each column
is a data feature.}

\item{known.mz}{The known m/z values to be matched to.}

\item{mass.matched}{A vector of indicators of whether the m/z of each EIC is
matched to the known m/z values. The default is NA, in which case it is
calculated within the function.}

\item{match.tol.ppm}{The tolerance level of m/z match.}

\item{do.plot}{Whether to produce plots of the ROCS.}

\item{pos.confidence}{The confidence level for the features matched to the
known feature list.}

\item{neg.confidence}{The confidence level for the features not matching to
the known feature list.}
}
\value{
A matrix of four columns. The first two columns are the VUS and AUC
without uncertainty. The next two columns are the VUS and AUC with
uncertainty.
}
\description{
For each column of an EIC data feature matrix, find its predictive power on
the m/z match to known metabolites.
