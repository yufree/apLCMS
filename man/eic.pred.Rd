\title{Internal function: calculate the score for each EIC based on prediction of
match status.}
\usage{
eic.pred(eic.rec, known.mz, mass.matched = NA, to.use = 10,
  do.plot = FALSE, match.tol.ppm = 5, do.grp.reduce = TRUE,
  remove.bottom = 5, max.fpr = 0.3, min.tpr = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{eic.rec}{The matrix of data features from every EIC. Each row is an
EIC. Each column is a data feature value.}

\item{known.mz}{The m/z values of the known metabolic features.}

\item{mass.matched}{An indicator vector. "1" means the corresponding EIC has
an m/z matched to known features.  The default is NA, in which case the
matching is done inside this function.}

\item{to.use}{The maximum number of data features to use in the predictive
models.}

\item{do.plot}{Whether diagnostic plots would be generated.}

\item{match.tol.ppm}{The tolerance level in the m/z match, at ppm scale.}

\item{do.grp.reduce}{Whether to reduce the data features first by reducing
each group of similar features into one.}

\item{remove.bottom}{The number of worst performing data features to remove
before model building. If true, the removal is done based on single
predictor ROC analysis.}

\item{max.fpr}{The threshold for selecting unmatched EICs. Each EIC is
assigned an FPR value based on the final prediction model. Those with FPR
smaller than this threshold will be selected. If a vector is provided, the
first one will be used. But all FPR values will also be returned. So other
functions will be able to make selections based on other threshold values.}

\item{min.tpr}{The threshold for selecting matched EICs. Each EIC is
assigned an TPR value based on the final prediction model. Those with TPR
larger than this threshold will be selected. If a vector is provided, the
first one will be used. But all TPR values will also be returned. So other
functions will be able to make selections based on other threshold values.}
}
\value{
A list item is returned.  \item{chosen}{ An indicator vector. "1"
means the EIC is selected; "0" means unselected. When multiple min.tpr
and/or max.fpr are provided, this vector corresponds to the combination of
the first min.tpr and max.fpr. } \item{fpr}{ The vector of FPR values, each
value corresponds to the FPR at the cutoff of the specific EIC. }
\item{tpr}{ The vector of TPR values, each value corresponds to the TPR at
the cutoff of the specific EIC. } \item{matched}{ An indicator vector. "1"
means matched to known features. "0" means unmatched.}
\item{pred.performance}{ Prediction performance of all models tested. }
\item{feature.rank.method}{ Which method is used for ranking features. }
\item{model}{ Which prediction model is used. } \item{feature importance}{
The importance score of all data features generated by the feature ranking
method. } \item{used.features}{ The names of the features used in the final
model. } \item{final.auc}{ The AUC of the selected model. }
}
\description{
This function uses predictive models to evaluate the data features, and give
scores to every EIC, which serves as the basis for EIC selection.
}
\details{
The function first subsample the EICs to balance the unmatched/matched. Then
it randomly split the data into training and testing set. Combinations of
feature ranking and predictive models are used, and their performance guaged
using the testing set. The overall best model is selected, and the EICs each
receive a score based on this model.

Although there is a single scoring system for all EICs, those matched are
treated differently than unmatched, because we have higher confidence in
them being real metabolites. The matched are selected using the "min.tpr"
threshold, to ensure the majority of them enter next step. Those unmatched
are selected using the "max.fpr" threshold.
